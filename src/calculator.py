"""
This module provides arithmetic operations for a calculator.

It includes functions for:
- Standard arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Specialized arithmetic: modulo operation for finding remainders.
- Error handling: validates inputs to prevent division or modulo by zero.

Each operation includes debug logging to track the execution flow.
